She is a singer, rapper, and influencer born on <strong>October 20, 1992</strong>, in Washington Heights, Manhattan.&nbsp;</p><p>Cynthia Pacheco was the name given to her at birth. Though she is of Salvadorian-Dominican origin, she likes to be recognized as "Mad Spanish". She has three siblings; Joel Pacheco, Giselle Pacheco, and Leslie Pacheco.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/Everipedia-1664086306905.jpg><h2>Cyn In Love & Hip-Hop: New York</h2><p><i>Love & Hip-Hop</i> is a popular media franchise that brings out women indulged in hip-hop. Cyn starred as the main cast in seasons five, nine, and ten. In season 4, she was the supporting cast and was introduced as the love interest of Eric Mena.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is Cyn's Relationship With Daniel Gibson?</h2><p>In season 2 of VH1 Family Reunion: Love & Hip Hop Edition, Cyn Santana and Daniel Gibson met each other. After spending some time together, they grew close to each other and kept hanging around together throughout the series.</p><p>The Family Reunion series took notice of this and tailed them as they reached a romantic level. The series let the fans witness the development of their relationship, and the fans indeed saw sparks in their relationship. They even assumed that Cyn and Daniel would soon make their relationship official.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/23/distractify7%20(1)-1663928219963.jpg><p>According to distractify, Daniel told Cyn that he wanted to be more than friends, not friend-zoned. However, Cyn let him know their relationship is not past the friendship stage.</p><p>So, Cyn and Daniel were never together. Indeed, they showed signs of intimacy and kept flirting with each other, but their relationship did not get past the friendship stage; this disappointed majority of their fans.</p><h2>How Cyn Ended Things With Erica Mena?</h2><p>In the series, Cyn came as the girlfriend of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Erica Mena</a>. The couple started their relationship in <strong>2013</strong>. Moreover, Cyn and Erica were the hottest couples in the series. Her relationship with Erica was her first homo relationship. Their relationship was hot as fire.</p><p>When their relationship was still good, Erica called Monday nights on VH1 as "Mena NIghts" and made sure of it. They both stated that their relationship was good.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/bossipp%20(1)-1664089422760.jpg><p>Before dating Cyn, Erica was in a relationship with Rich Dollaz. Things turned out bad after Erica once again got involved with him. The attraction Erica felt for Rich, too, was noticeable, which caused tension between them and caused Erica and Cyn to butt heads. They stopped having fun, and more troubles came arising.&nbsp;</p><p>Erica was spotted kissing Bow Wow at “106 & Park” and became the effective end of their relationship. Eventually, the couple grew into more misunderstandings, and they broke up. Anyone who watched the series knows the breakup was such a mess.</p><p>After a short while, she started dating producer Ray Stacks in <strong>2014</strong>. They soon broke up in <strong>2015</strong>.</p><h2>Her Shortlived Engagement With Joe Budden</h2><p>During season nine of the series; <i>Love and Hip-Hop: Newyork</i>, Cyn Santana and Joe Budden announced their relationship in 2016. The series and fans explored the love and the battles in their relationship. In<strong> December 2017</strong>, they had a baby together.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/Cyn-Santanas-boyfriend-1664087293076.jpg><p>After having their baby, Joe proposed to Cyn around the show's finale. Cyn agreed, and they decided to get engaged. However, after just four months of being engaged, in <strong>March 2019</strong>, the couple announced their breakup.</p><p>According to Cyn, she decided to break up with Joe because he cheated on her. However, Joe never responded to these allegations. As expected, after their breakup, their relationship was sour. Even then, for the sake of their child, they decided to co-parent the child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/facebook%20(1)-1664087365849.jpg><h3>What Did Netizens Have To Say?</h3><p>Before Joe dated Cyn, he was in an on-and-off relationship with <strong>Tahiry Jose</strong>. They had dated for quite a long time and often took breaks from their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Netizens have criticized Joe, saying that he only dated Cyn because she looked like his ex, Tahiry Jose. And even the fans of Cyn agree. And at some time, they were convinced that it happened for good as Cyn now looks much happier single.</p><h2>Did Cyn Santana Really Dated Drake?&nbsp;</h2><p>A year before Cyn was cast on the VH1 series, she was rumored to be dating Drake. They met on the set during the shooting of 2 Chainz's video for "<i>No Lie</i>".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/whosdatedwho%20(1)-1664104209760.jpg><p>After being spotted together several times at different events, rumors of them dating flew off. However, neither of the concerned persons has ever responded to the rumor. So, the rumor still remains unverified.</p><h2>So How Rich Is Cyn? Let Know Her Net Worth:</h2><p>The net worth of Cyn Santana is estimated to be around<strong> $600 thousand.</strong> Another Dominican rapper and singer, <a href=#><strong>Mozart La Para</strong></a><strong> </strong>has a total fortune of around <strong>$1 Million.</strong> She has been making good money with Love and Hip-Hop. However, the series is not the only source of her income.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyn owns a clothing line called NU. In an interview with VIBE, she said,</p><p>“NU is not for the faint of heart,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>VIBE</i></a>. It is for the confident and fearless woman ready to conquer her world. The confident and brave – women who aren’t afraid to feel comfortable in their own skin. Whether she’s in the office or having a night on the town.”</p><h2>Cyn's Little One</h2><p>From Cyn's relationship with Joe, she gave birth to a baby boy and named him <strong>Lexington Budden</strong>. She gave birth to her first child on <strong>December 15, 2017</strong>. After giving birth to her son, she revealed that she suffered from Postpartum depression.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/bossip%20(2)-1664086979334.jpg><p>She stated that she was able to get through her postpartum depression through prayers, self-care, and the practice of patience. After going through the experience, she posted a video on her insta advising moms about postpartum depression where she stated:&nbsp;</p><p>“‘...you gonn get through it. Postpartum depression. There’s so many layers to it. The hormonal changes, the mental changes, the physical changes but I wanna start with the spirit first,” she captioned a video that offered even more advise.&nbsp;</p><p>And she also encouraged the moms to take professional help. Also, she expressed:&nbsp;</p><p>“Of course, you should probably go to the doctor, and speak to somebody about how you feel,” she concludes. “Some women take medicine. Some women take vitamins. I, personally, didn’t take medicine. I’m not really into taking drugs.”</p><h2>Before Love & Hip Hop</h2><p>Before Cyn appeared in the series <i>Love and Hip-Hop</i>, she was pretty popular as the video vixen doing impersonations of celebrities like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nicki Minaj</a>, Ray J, and Kat Stacks. With her bubbly personality and charms, her skits went viral and brought her to the limelight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/23/instagram4%20(1)-1663931400628.jpg><p>Cyn even had a musical career which she is still pursuing.
