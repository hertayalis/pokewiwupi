In an interview with the online publication, Newton stated "I think we lucked out having a team of hosts that really got along very well and had Phil’s vision, and we’re able to piggyback on that really quickly because he has such a clear vision, and he knew exactly what he wanted and such a concise idea of what he wanted and then having four people who really like each other and who can write really well. It was just energy. It was a collaboration that really started to take off." The statement was in response to the SourceFed YouTube channel reaching 500,000 subscribers.</p><p>In 2018, Newton along with founding SourceFed hosts <a href=#>Joe Bereta</a>, <a href=#>Elliott Morgan</a>, and <a href=#>Steve Zaragoza</a>, launched a production company and YouTube channel entitled The Valleyfolk. The Valleyfolk features various series. Among them are The Valleycast, a podcast series, and Your Show, a variety series. The Valleyfolk competed on the NBC comedy competition show Bring the Funny, winning the show's first season in 2019. On September 23, 2019, the other members of The Valleyfolk voted to terminate Newton's employment with the group.</p><p>On March 28, 2015, Newton appeared in her last video before her resignation from SourceFed, alongside former SourceFed host Ross Everett.</p><p>Aside from online works, Newton appeared in the 2014 April Fools episode of Tosh.0. That July, Newton was announced to be included in the cast of Comedy Central's series, CC: Social Scene.</p><p>In March 2013, Newton appeared alongside SourceFed co-host <a href=#>Steve Zaragoza</a> and creator <a href=#>Philip DeFranco</a> in a Taco Bell advertisement. Later, in May, SourceFed launched a spin-off channel, SourceFed Nerd, on which Newton also appeared.</p><p>Also in May 2013, Newton appeared in an episode of the Fine Brothers's YouTubers React, alongside SourceFed co-host, <a href=#>Steve Zaragoza</a>. Newton would again work with the Fine Brothers as she joined the cast of MyMusic for its second season. On the series, Newton played the character of Country, Idol's cousin. Newton also appeared in Toby Turner's HEELY COPS video.</p><p>Newton made appearances on YouTube channels outside of SourceFed and Fine Brothers-related series; Newton appeared in the ninth episode of Rhett and Link's The Mythical Show, along with Bereta and Morgan. Newton also voice acted as Tanya Burkowitz and Katelynn Zales in the stop-motion animated web series The Most Popular Girls in School, in 2013.</p><p>Lee Newton was raised in Coarsegold, California. She believes that she is "a blend of her Father's wit and sarcasm and her Mother's absolute absurdity." She also has a brother and a sister. Her brother, Jake, is a musician, and has his own YouTube channel. On March 2, 2012, a video was posted to her brother, Jake Newton's YouTube channel of the two singing a song cover of Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance With Somebody".</p><p>On February 6, 2012, Lee Newton's fellow co-hosts, <a href=#>Elliott Morgan</a> and <a href=#>Joe Bereta</a>, released a video to the SourceFed YouTube channel, concerning the list of Maxim's Hot 100, which is released every year. Without Lee knowing, her co-hosts encouraged the viewers to vote for her as a 'write-in'. The decision to do this was the overwhelming response from other SourceFed videos; specifically AskMen's Top 99 Most Desirable Women of 2012. The feedback contained comments that thought Newton should be included in these lists. The Maxim voting website added a CAPTCHA after a flood of votes for her. On 3 April 2012, Maxim posted a list of the most popular 'write-in' candidates, and included Lee Newton, writing that she had 'list potential'. In result, she reached #57 in Maxim's Hot 100. The following year, Newton received a Maxim profile.</p><p><a href=#>Ashley Rose</a> Newton (born April 13, 1985), known professionally as Lee Newton, is an American actress, comedian and Web personality.
