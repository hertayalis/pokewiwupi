We have gamers (budget and enthusiast), casual users, audio enthusiasts, HTPC users, storage users, power users, enthusiasts, modders, silent users, overclockers, extreme users or perhaps a combination of many.&nbsp; Therefore, when it comes to designing a range of boards, a motherboard manufacturer has priority targets.&nbsp; They can design either a product to go for one target, or a product to cover several.&nbsp; ASUS have a minimum of 13 boards in their current Z77 lineup (not covering H77), with a few more still to be released.&nbsp; One of those 13 is the P8Z77-V Deluxe, a high end product focused on power users who want extremes of functionality and the best of most worlds - an Intel NIC (+Realtek), more SATA, dual band WiFi, fan control, provision for Thunderbolt as well as regular ASUS features such as BIOS Flashback, Q-LED, the BIOS itself and AI Suite software.&nbsp; Even with all of this, it also transpires that the Deluxe is quite good at throughput and IO as well.</p><p><strong>ASUS P8Z77-V Deluxe Overview</strong></p><p>Building a system comes with many constraints - the main one in my experience as a recent student is usually price.&nbsp; However, at a recent UK iSeries LAN event, you could have fooled me - for many people present, money was seemingly no object.&nbsp; This was the enthusiast market, so showing off that custom water loop in an appropriate case was vital.&nbsp; However, one common theme was present throughout the day - even enthusiasts have an update cycle.&nbsp; It was obvious as I was walking around and talking to enthusiasts that when you have a water locked system running dual GTX 480s, the impetus for some of them was to spend big every now and again, rather than crawl for upgrades.&nbsp; There were some Sandy Bridge systems, a number of Lynnfield/Clarkdale systems, some Phenom II, as well as Nehalem knocking about, with users looking at potential routes to last them another 3-4 years.</p><p>With this in mind, there are current two obvious answers when coming from systems a few years old and if you want to go Intel - jump to Sandy Bridge-E, or venture into Ivy Bridge.&nbsp; For a solid system, there needs to be a motherboard underneath which will work, perform, and if possible, revolutionize the system as a whole.&nbsp; ASUS believe they have done this with the P8Z77-V Deluxe.</p><p>The P8Z77-V Deluxe thus comes at a very high-enthusiast Z77 price bracket, around the <a href=#>$275</a> mark.&nbsp; This knocks heavily on the door on low-to-mid range X79 solutions.&nbsp; But rather than getting a low-to-mid range X79, we have the cream of enthusiast Z77.&nbsp; This means the Deluxe comes with most of the features that users want on a high-end product - dual band WiFi, dual NIC (one Intel), fan control, more SATA, debug tools, and additional USB 3.0.&nbsp; This is on top of what ASUS features across most of their channel range - USB 3.0 Boost, AI Suite, Fan Xpert II, Q-LED, dual intelligent processors, DTS UltraPC II + DTS Connect, SSD caching, control for 3-pin and 4-pin fan headers, and digital power delivery for the CPU, iGPU and DRAM.&nbsp; Realistically the only things missing are a PCIe expanding PLX chip (up to another $30 expense) for more than 2-way GPU, a more premium audio solution (again, would be another ~$30), integrated Thunderbolt (yet another ~$30, but the Thunderbolt header on board connects to a to-be-released ASUS TB add-in card) or perhaps mSATA (even though not really an enthusiast end requirement).</p><p>The Deluxe takes center stage in terms of performance in each of our 2D benchmarks - thanks to a combination of design and MultiCore Enhancement, the Deluxe comes top out of our Z77 testing often by a noticeable margin.&nbsp; In many areas it parallels the P8Z77-V Pro we have already tested, either performing the same as or better than the Pro.</p><p><strong>Visual Inspection</strong></p><p>In the next notch up above the Pro in the channel board segregation, ASUS sell the Deluxe.&nbsp; This will be the first ASUS Deluxe board we have reviewed at AnandTech since the Llano mini-ITX F1A75-I Deluxe last year.&nbsp; In comparison to the P8Z77-V Pro, the Deluxe features several upgrades in terms of functionality and comfort.</p><p>The first to note is the increased power delivery to the CPU over the Pro – this time in the form of a 16 + 4 phase power delivery.&nbsp; As a result, the VRM heatsinks to the left of the CPU are directly connected via a heatpipe to another heatsink below the socket.&nbsp; Also on board are the enthusiast power/reset buttons and two-digit debug, a Thunderbolt header, Q-LED Debug lighting, and the use of dual NICs on the I/O, in the form of an Intel 82579V and a Realtek 8111F.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5833/ASUSDeluxeTop_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Due to the positioning of the heatsinks on the Deluxe compared to the Pro, the socket area seems a bit smaller (for example, the left hand heatsink is moved further in towards the socket). It is possible that big air coolers would perhaps have a tougher time if they do not fit into Intel’s socket specification, but in order to help, ASUS have made the heatsinks short to alleviate this issue a touch.&nbsp; Around the socket itself, we still have access to five fan headers – two 4-pin on the top of the board, one 4-pin to the bottom left of the main VRM heatsink, and one 4-pin either side of the 24-pin ATX power connector.&nbsp; A sixth fan header on board is found at the bottom next to the two-digit debug output.&nbsp; All the fan headers are controllable through the BIOS and OS software, and the chassis headers can control 3-pin fans as well.</p><p>Above the main power connector on the right hand side are the MemOK button and the TPU switch (for a fast automatic overclock). Below it is a USB 3.0 header, and a set of eight SATA ports.&nbsp; Similar to the ASUS Pro, we have four SATA 3 Gbps from the PCH, two SATA 6 Gbps also from the PCH, and two SATA 3 Gbps from a different controller – the Marvell 9128.&nbsp; This allows RAID 0/1 on these two SATA 6 Gbps ports as well as ASUS SSD Caching.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5833/ASUSDeluxeEndOn_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The south side of the board still contains front panel headers and USB 2.0 ports, but also comes with the aforementioned power/reset buttons and two-digit debug display.&nbsp; We also find a ClearCMOS button on board, useful for overclockers, and a Thunderbolt header, for use with a future ASUS Thunderbolt add-in card.&nbsp; In terms of the PCIe, we have a little bit of potential confusion for users and reviewers - in the middle between the PCIe is a PLX chip.&nbsp; This is not the PLX PXE 8747 chip that increases the PCIe lane count - this one on the Deluxe is present to provide extra data transfer access for the various controllers on the motherboard.&nbsp; This means that the third full length PCIe in black is like many other Z77 boards in that this is a PCIe 2.0 x4, non-GPU port.&nbsp; From the top, we have a PCIe x1, x16 (x8 in Multi-GPU), x1, x1, x8, x1, x4.&nbsp; As a result, there is no PCIe to PCI bridge chip on this high-end model for PCI slots.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5833/ASUSP8Z77-VDeluxeSchematic_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5833/ASUSDeluxeIO_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>For the back panel, ASUS have done a juggling act deciding what to include.&nbsp; On the far left is a set of four USB 2.0 ports (black), a mini-PCIe dual band WiFi + Bluetooth module, two USB 3.0 (blue), two eSATA, optical SPDIF output, HDMI output, DisplayPort, dual gigabit Ethernet, another four USB 3.0 ports (blue), a BIOS flashback button, and audio outputs.&nbsp; So in the name of a double NIC and 10 total USB ports on the back panel, we have lost D-Sub, DVI, IEEE 1394 and a ClearCMOS button (ClearCMOS is now on the board at the bottom).</p><p><strong>Board Features</strong></p><table border=0 width=100%><tbody readability=19.381097560976><tr width=100%><td bgcolor=#016a96 class=contentwhite colspan=2><strong>ASUS P8Z77-V Deluxe</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Price</strong></td><td><a href=#>Link</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size</strong></td><td>ATX</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU Interface</strong></td><td>LGA-1155</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chipset</strong></td><td>Intel Z77</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Memory Slots</strong></td><td>Four DDR3 DIMM slots supporting up to 32 GB<br>Up to Dual Channel</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video Outputs</strong></td><td>DisplayPort, HDMI</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Onboard LAN</strong></td><td>Intel 82579V<br>Realtek 8111F</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Onboard Audio</strong></td><td>Realtek ALC898<br>Supporting DTS UltraPC II and DTS Connect</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Expansion Slots</strong></td><td>2 x PCIe x16 Gen3 (x16, x8/8)<br>1 x PCIe x16 Gen2 (x4)<br>4 x PCIe x1 Gen2</td></tr><tr readability=13><td><strong>Onboard SATA/RAID</strong></td><td>2 x SATA 6 Gbps (PCH), Support for RAID 0, 1, 5, 10<br>2 x SATA 6 Gbps (Marvell PCIe 9128), RAID 0, 1<br>4 x SATA 3 Gbps (PCH), Support for RAID 0, 1, 5, 10<br>2 x eSATA 6 Gbps (ASMedia)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>USB</strong></td><td>Four USB 3.0 at rear (2 PCH, 2 ASMedia)<br>Two USB 3.0 headers on board (PCH, ASMedia)<br>Eight USB 2.0 (4 back panel, 4 on board)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Onboard</strong></td><td>4 x SATA 6 Gbps<br>4 x SATA 3 Gbps<br>1 x USB 3.0 Headers<br>2 x USB 2.0 Headers<br>6 x Fan Headers<br>1 x SPDIF Header<br>1 x Front Panel Audio Header<br>1 x Thunderbolt Header<br>MemOK!
