An eternal optimist, and a bit of a scoundrel, he loves his theater above all and will do anything to preserve it.</p><p>Facing the crumbling of his life’s ambition, he takes one final chance to restore his fading jewel to its former glory by producing the world’s greatest singing competition. Five contestants emerge: a mouse, a timid elephant, a pig, a gorilla and a punk-rock porcupine.</p><p>Seth MacFarlane is an Arrogant Frank Sinatra-Singing Mouse In the Animated Movie ‘Sing’ Seth MacFarlane is an arrogant mouse with a Napoleon complex in the upcoming animated movie “Sing.” He rocks out a cover of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” in the film, which is out Dec.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to the Mouse in Sing 2</h2><p>Mike, the protagonist of Sing, disappears at the end of the movie. Some believe he has been abducted by aliens, while others think he may have gone off to start a new life. The truth is unknown.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did The Mouse From Sing Die?</h2><p>Well it’s implied the mouse in the movie Sing died at the end of Sing. Driven by his egotistical ambitions, he lead himself to his own demise at the hand of a mob bear boss. The same one that he himself tried to cheat during their card game. That’s why the choice of song he sang at the end.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Mike in Sing at The End?</h2><p>In “Sing” Mike the Mouse is eaten by a bear. It’s rumored that he got in too deep with the gambling Bears and lost everything including his money, his home, even his beloved fedora.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sing Movie Plot</h2><p>In Calatonia, a city of anthropomorphic animals, koala Buster Moon owns a struggling theater, and is threatened with foreclosure by bank representative llama Judith. He decides to hold a singing competition with a prize of $1,000, but a typo made by his elderly assistant iguana Miss Crawly adds two extra zeros to the prize money. The misprinted flyers are blown out of the window by a fan before they can be proofread, and float across the city.</p><p>Crowds of animals gather to audition, and Buster selects his contestants. Among them are housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; punk-rock porcupine Ash; teenage gorilla Johnny, son of a criminal gang leader named Big Daddy; street musician mouse Mike; and an exuberant pig named Gunter. Teenage elephant Meena fails her audition due to stage fright, Ash’s self-absorbed boyfriend and co-auditionee Lance is upset to be dismissed from the contest, and Rosita is paired with Gunter for a dance routine.</p><p>After Buster discovers the flyers advertise a prize of $100,000, he joins his friend sheep Eddie on a visit to Eddie’s wealthy grandmother, former theater superstar Nana Noodleman. Nana is reluctant to sponsor the prize money, but agrees to attend a private preview of the show before making a decision.</p><p>Pressured by her grandfather, Meena attempts to request a second audition, but settles on being Buster’s stagehand instead. After some acts withdraw from the competition, Meena is offered a spot in the show, but again struggles to overcome her fear. Further problems soon arise. Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, believing her motherly duties have caused her to lose her passion. Lance cheats on Ash, causing her to break up with him, and later to break down crying during a rehearsal.</p><p>Mike, assuming he will win the competition, takes out a massive loan from the bank to buy a flashy car and swindles a group of bears in a card game. Johnny, forced by Big Daddy to partake in a heist as a getaway driver, sneaks away to a rehearsal. Traffic prevents Johnny from returning to the heist in time, resulting in the arrest and incarceration of Big Daddy and his gang, straining their relationship. After an accident c auses stage lights to fall and break, Buster has the stage rebuilt and fills a glass tank with water so that luminescent squids can be used to light the stage.</p><p>Desperate, Johnny attempts to steal the prize money for his father’s bail, but when he sees a note on Buster’s desk praising his talents, Johnny resolves to focus on his musical career instead. At the same time, Rosita regains her passion for dancing while grocery shopping, and Ash composes a song that Buster likes. On the day of the preview, the bears Mike had cheated locate him, and demand their money back. Mike directs them to Buster; the bears break open the prize chest, but it is nowhere near $100,000. Shocked by the lack of money, the rest of the contestants question Buster, and the squid tank shatters under everyone’s weight. The flooded theater implodes, and Judith repossesses the lot, while a disheartened Buster takes up residence with Eddie and supports himself by washing cars.</p><p>Meena goes to the rubble of the theater and sings out loud to music on her headphones, inspiring Buster to stage an outdoor show. Despite attempts from Judith to halt the show, it takes place on the lot of the former theater, with Meena’s and Rosita’s families in attendance. More animals are drawn into the audience when the show is broadcast live on the local news. Rosita’s husband Norman is roused by his wife’s talent, Big Daddy breaks out of prison and travels to the lot to reconcile with Johnny and apologize, Lance is impressed by Ash’s original rock song “Set It All Free,” the bears find Mike and chase him away, and Meena overcomes her stage fright and gives an enthusiastic performance. The show is a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. She purchases the lot, and the theater is rebuilt and reopened.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where Can I Watch Sing Movie?</h2><p>Sing can be watched on Redbox., ROW8, Prime Video or Vudu on your Roku device.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to the Mouse Sing 2 FAQs</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When was Sing movie released?</h2><p>Sing first screened during the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2016, followed by its premiere at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on December 3.
