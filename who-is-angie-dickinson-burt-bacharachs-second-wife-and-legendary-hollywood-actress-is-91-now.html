She was one of the most popular leading ladies in Hollywood during the 1950s. Where is the legendary actress now?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Angie-Dickinson-actor.webp alt="Angie Dickinson actor" width=2046 height=2016 data-sizes="(max-width: 2046px) 100vw, 2046px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Angie_Dickinson_Life_and_Career></span>Angie Dickinson: Life and Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born Angeline Brown on September 30, 1931, Dickinson hails from Kulm, North Dakota. She paved her way to stardom in the 1950s, quickly becoming one of Hollywood’s favourite leading ladies.</p><p>Her father was a newspaper publisher and editor. He worked on the Kulm Messenger and the Edgeley Mail. Dickinson has three siblings- two sisters named Mary Lou Belmont and Janet Lee Brown and one brother. While Dickinson was born in a small city, she had big dreams of making it in Hollywood which came true sooner than later. She was hardly 20 years old when she got her big break in the film industry.</p><p>After winning a beauty contest in her home state, she caught the eye of a casting director, and her journey towards stardom began. Over her six-decade-long career, Angie starred in over 50 films and earned three <a href=# rel=noopener>Golden Globe</a> awards. She delivered her breakthrough performance in&nbsp;Rio Bravo alongside John Wayne and Dean Martin in 1959. Her outstanding performance in the TV series Police Woman&nbsp;earned her a Golden Globe Award. Her talent shone the brightest with the 1980 Brian De Palma thriller movie, Dressed to Kill.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Angie_Dickinsons_Personal_Life></span>Angie Dickinson’s Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Apart from her glorious acting career, Dickinson was also well-known for her romance and affairs with elite celebrities. Angie Dickinson was associated with the legendary singer Frank Sinatra with whom she had a 10-year-long affair. The actress was also reported to be linked with the former US president, John F Kennedy, which Dickinson has denied.</p><p>Dickinson met pop music composer, Burt Bacharach in 1964 and the couple hit it off right away. Soon after, t<span>hey tied the knot on May 5, 1965, in the Silver Bell wedding chapel in Las Vegas. This was Bucharach’s second marriage and the couple had a daughter named Nikki. Unfortunately, Nikki was born prematurely and was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. Their marriage lasted 15 years before they decided to part ways. In a 2008 interview, Angie Dickinson told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> that their marriage was a mistake.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I spoiled [Nikki]. It obviously damaged the marriage, plus we had other problems. We really never should have married. We should have stayed in a romance, in love, and I should have walked away long before.”</span></p><p><span>“It was exciting when it was good—and it was great a lot of the time.”</span></p><p>However, their marriage wasn’t as heartbreaking for Angie Dickinson as her daughter’s death. Nikki committed suicide at the age of 40. While talking to&nbsp;CBS Sunday Morning, about her daughter’s sad demise, she said,</p><p>“She had no coping skills, so she just took her life. She was very smart and funny and wonderful, so all the memories of her are my best memories.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Angie-Dickinson-daughter.webp alt="Angie Dickinson daughter" width=994 height=779 data-sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Angie_Dickinson_Now></span>Where Is Angie Dickinson Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Angie Dickinson is 90 years old today and lives in her Beverly Hills home in Los Angeles, California. She resides alone at her Beverly Hills home and is content with her lifestyle.</p><p>Her marriage with Burt was her second marriage as well. Angie Brown became Angie Dickinson after she married a former football player named Gene Dickinson in 1952. Her affair with Frank Sinatra was the talk of the town and Dickinson revealed that they came very close to being married. She told&nbsp;CBS,</p><p>“[Frank Sinatra] said ‘You know, I’m not going to marry an actress.’ And I said, ‘Well, I don’t blame you. I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.’</p><p>“And I actually didn’t want to marry him. So, I didn’t want him to ask me to marry him. ‘Cause I didn’t wanna say no to Frank Sinatra!”</p><p>However, Angie Dickinson has no regrets about her life. She told a publication that she was lucky to start her career at the time she did.</p><p>“I was lucky. I came along at the right time for so many great things. I met some great stars and stayed friends with many and lovers with some. It was a fantastic life, really. And it still is.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Angie-Dickinson-now.webp alt="Angie Dickinson now" width=1200 height=900 data-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2iuoaddnsBurc2goJ5llJ6wrLXNrKanZZKqv7V5wZqaoZmilrCpv4ysnJynnpl6uLXFnmSappRiuaazxKebmqqpYrWwuMuyrqinlGKupMDRnqqsZZmoenp9jKemsGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-angie-dickinson-burt-bacharachs-second-wife-and-legendary-hollywood-actress-is-91-now.html&text=Who%20Is%20Angie%20Dickinson%3f%20Burt%20Bacharach%27s%20Second%20Wife%20And%20Legendary%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Is%2091%20Now&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-angie-dickinson-burt-bacharachs-second-wife-and-legendary-hollywood-actress-is-91-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-angie-dickinson-burt-bacharachs-second-wife-and-legendary-hollywood-actress-is-91-now.html&title=Who%20Is%20Angie%20Dickinson%3f%20Burt%20Bacharach%27s%20Second%20Wife%20And%20Legendary%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Is%2091%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-angie-dickinson-burt-bacharachs-second-wife-and-legendary-hollywood-actress-is-91-now.html&title=Who%20Is%20Angie%20Dickinson%3f%20Burt%20Bacharach%27s%20Second%20Wife%20And%20Legendary%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Is%2091%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-angie-dickinson-burt-bacharachs-second-wife-and-legendary-hollywood-actress-is-91-now.html&title=Who%20Is%20Angie%20Dickinson%3f%20Burt%20Bacharach%27s%20Second%20Wife%20And%20Legendary%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Is%2091%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-angie-dickinson-burt-bacharachs-second-wife-and-legendary-hollywood-actress-is-91-now.html&description=Who%20Is%20Angie%20Dickinson%3f%20Burt%20Bacharach%27s%20Second%20Wife%20And%20Legendary%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Is%2091%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ye-shuhua.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ye Shuhua">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./udy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=UDY>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
