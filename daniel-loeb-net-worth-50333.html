Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1984</span><p>From 1984-87, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He then worked as <a href=#>Director</a> of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing. After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity <a href=#>Investors</a> and then, from 1991-94, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC, where he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities.

Under Loeb's guidance, Third Point Managementâ€™s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 â€“ Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%. In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year. In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%. Loeb appeared in <i>Forbes'</i> 2013 list of the world's 40 <a href=#>richest</a> hedge-fund managers and traders.

Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.</p><span>2005</span><p>A 2005 <i>New York Times</i> article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"</p><span>2007</span><p>In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the companyâ€™s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.</p><span>2009</span><p>Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc. In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in <a href=#>Business</a> with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like <a href=#>Business</a>."</p><span>2011</span><p>In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.</p><span>2012</span><p>On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.

At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' <i>Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta)</i> for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.</p><span>2014</span><p>On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the <a href=#>American</a> Enterprise Institute and the <a href=#>Dalai Lama</a>. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his <a href=#>Business</a> and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.</p><span>2015</span><p>In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.</p><span>2016</span><p>In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating <a href=#>Investors</a>." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I <a href=#>Directors</a>, "Mr. Isaka should be rewardedâ€”not demotedâ€”for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isnâ€™t a dynasty. This is a corporation." Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.</p><span>2017</span><p>In June 2017, Third Point disclosed its ownership of approximately 40 million shares of NestlÃ©, making it the company's sixth-largest shareholder according to Standard & Poorâ€™s Global Market Intelligence.</p><span>2018</span><p>According to <i>Forbes Magazine</i>, his net worth is $3.2 billion USD as of February 16, 2018.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1961 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>American billionaires</a> <a href=#>American financial analysts</a> <a href=#>American financiers</a> <a href=#>American hedge fund managers</a> <a href=#>American investors</a> <a href=#>American money managers</a> <a href=#>American stock traders</a> <a href=#>Businesspeople from Los Angeles</a> <a href=#>California Democrats</a> <a href=#>New York (state) Democrats</a> <a href=#>Columbia University alumni</a> <a href=#>Directors of Yahoo!</a> <a href=#>Jewish American philanthropists</a> <a href=#>Stock and commodity market managers</a> <a href=#>Transcendental Meditation practitioners</a> <a href=#>University of California, Berkeley people</a> <a href=#>People from Santa Monica, California</a> <a href=#>20th-century American businesspeople</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeUlruqsctmo6idkmK7psCMsKarrJhignF%2Fkmw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdaniel-loeb-net-worth-50333.html&text=Daniel%20Loeb%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdaniel-loeb-net-worth-50333.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdaniel-loeb-net-worth-50333.html&title=Daniel%20Loeb%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdaniel-loeb-net-worth-50333.html&title=Daniel%20Loeb%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdaniel-loeb-net-worth-50333.html&title=Daniel%20Loeb%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdaniel-loeb-net-worth-50333.html&description=Daniel%20Loeb%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./do-you-tip-for-botox-injectors-explain-7511084.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Do You Tip for Botox?
