Howard landed awkwardly on his left ankle in the first half of the Wolverines’ game against Minnesota. He was forced out of the match and placed into a walking boot. Here’s everything you should know!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Jett Howard is a freshman basketball player for the Michigan Wolverines. He is known for his unique combination of size, shooting and downhill scoring, which allows him to play all three perimeter positions.</p><p>Howard is a sharpshooter known for making plays for others and a strong floor facilitator who brings a solid defensive mindset to the court.</p><p>He is a confident player who relishes big games and big moments.</p><p>However, It was a worrying moment for Michigan basketball and their freshman, Jett Howard, when he landed awkwardly on his left ankle in the first half of the Wolverines’ game against Minnesota.</p><p>The Juwan Howard coached team won 60-56; however, the injury prompted concern for the player.</p><p>Although forced out of the match and placed into a walking boot, Howard has managed to avoid the worst. Here are the details!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also view</strong>: <a href=#>Meet Kobe Bufkin From Michigan, Age Parents And Family&nbsp;</a></p><h2><strong>Jett Howard Got Jnjured?</strong></h2><p>It appears Jett Howard may have avoided serious injury after landing awkwardly on his left ankle in the first half of Michigan’s match against Minnesota.</p><p>Coach Juwan Howard has offered reassurance to the issue, stating that X-Rays have come back negative, and all that is needed now is to wait and see what the swelling shows.</p><p>Jett has been a valuable asset to the team due to his size, shooting and versatility; while Isaiah Barnes and Joey Baker are expected to step up should the freshman not make it back in time for Thursday’s game.</p><h2><strong>Medical Evaluation</strong></h2><p>The extent of Jett Howard’s ankle injury is yet to be fully determined and depends on the medical evaluation.</p><p>This will factor in the potential swelling and bruises, as well as the individual pain and discomfort levels that Jett experiences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/279697407_376619044397679_8472719342096781106_n-1.jpg><p>The medical team at Michigan has a duty of care toward the injured player, and therefore, Howard must be monitored and treated with the utmost care and precision.</p><h2><strong>Replacing Jett Howard?</strong></h2><p>Although it looks like Jett Howard may make a triumphant return for Michigan, there is a possibility he may not be able to make it back in time for Thursday’s game against the Purdue Boilermakers.</p><p>If that is the case, then Joey Baker and Isaiah Barnes will attempt to fill the void.</p><p>Both Baker and Barnes have shown some impressive performances lately and have the potential to fill the gap, but it is clear that Howard is still a vital component of the team’s success.</p><h2><strong>Impact Of Jett Howards Injury</strong></h2><p>Despite the news of the X-Rays returning negative and the initial signs being positive, the absence of Jett Howard still carries vast implications for the Michigan Wolverines.</p><p>They are currently in second place in the Big Ten, and any missed game from their freshman star could result in a slip down the rankings.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential for both Jett and the team that he makes a full recovery as soon as possible.</p><h2><strong>Jett Howard: A Versatile Player</strong></h2><p>The freshman has quickly become an integral part of the Michigan Wolverines team and is especially admired by his Father for his versatility and ability to fill various roles.</p><p>The 6’7″ guard has a strong frame and a solid motor when on the defensive end, but his main commodity comes from the open jump shot with range.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/270768059_3034128376829895_8578934818255220995_n-1.jpg><p>As well as this, he is also a facilitator and knows how to run an offense. His best contributions are made when playing off the ball rather than as a primary ball handler, as his efficiency as a three-point shooter improves significantly.</p><h2><strong>Jett Howards 2019-20 Stats:</strong></h2><p>When looking at Jett Howard’s stats for the 2019/2020 season, it becomes clear why he is such an integral part of the team.</p><p>He is averaging 10.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game while shooting an impressive 41.7% from three-point range.</p><p>Howard is also converting 57.7% of his attempts, which is the highest field goal percentage on the team. His influence on the team reaches beyond the court.</p><h2><strong>When is Jett Howard returning To The Court?</strong></h2><p>Jett Howard will be eager to return to the court for the Wolverines whenever he is given the all-clear.&nbsp;</p><p>Although, one must assume that coach Juwan Howard will be cautious with the freshman and won’t stress him too much.</p><p>It is up to Howard and the medical team to decide when the six-foot guard is ready to return to complete playing duties.</p><h2><strong>Jett Howard&nbsp; Parents And Age</strong></h2><p>Born on September 14, 2003, in Chicago, Illinois, Jett Howard is 19 years old as of 2023. He is the son of Jenine and Juwan Howard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/285454593_1178482792943977_1929434735528176822_n-1.jpg><p>His Father, Juwan Howard, is the U-M’s David and Meredith Kaplan Men’s Basketball Coach, a former member of the “Fab Five” and former NBA standout and champion as a player and assistant coach.</p><p>Howard is currently enrolled in the College of Literature, Science and Arts.
