The couple celebrated their union among friends and family, and the player shared the news on his Instagram account.</p><p class=dh>This rare glimpse into the player's private life has delighted fans. Oher defends his privacy ferociously and rarely posts about his personal life on social media. The player doesn't usually give interviews, and the new Mrs. Oher is even more reclusive. Here's all we know about Tiffani Roy Oher, Michael Oher's wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/87a36430bd31bc4e724a1a1b4e16f72d.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Michael Oher at Qualcomm Stadium in November, 2012 in San Diego, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3775845/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">Michael Oher</a> was born on May 28, 1986, in Memphis, Tennessee, one of the 12 children of Denise Oher, a woman who struggled with alcohol and substance abuse issues. As a result, Oher was placed in foster care at seven.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Michael Oher has become an example and a beacon of hope for the many children who have lived lives of desperation like his.</strong></h3><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/athlete/michael-oher>Oher's childhood</a> was spent in a series of foster homes, and in high school, he started to play football and applied to Briarcrest Christian School. He was placed with the family of a classmate, Leigh Anne, and Sean Tuohy, who fostered Oher and ended up adopting him.</p><p class=dh>Oher received several offers to attend colleges eager to have him on their football teams but ended up attending the University of Mississippi, his foster parents' alma mater.</p><p class=dh>The story of Oher's struggle to make up for a lifetime's neglect of his studies and fulfill his dream of going to college and playing football with the Tuohys' support was the basis of the film "The Blind Side" starring <a class="me a" href=#>Sandra Bullock</a>, Tim McGraw, and Quinton Aaron as Oher.</p><p class=dh>The film was based on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/sports/michael-oher-who-inspired-the-blind-side-is-married/>the 2006 book</a>, "The Blind Side," Michael Lewis' biography of Oher, and told the harrowing story of his difficult childhood and eventual triumph. It was nominated for Best Film and won Bullock the coveted Oscar for Best Actress in a Motion Picture.</p><p class=dh>However, Oher didn't like how the film portrayed him and wrote his autobiography "I Beat the Odds: From Homelessness to The Blind Side and Beyond" in 2011. Still, the story of his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/sports/michael-oher-who-inspired-the-blind-side-is-married/>seventeen-year romance </a>with Tiffany Roy Oher is still untold.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Who is Tiffany Roy, Michael Oher's wife?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Tifanny is from New Orleans, and she is a businesswoman, an entrepreneur, and a philanthropist. She created a line of women's clothing, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thefeminishcollection.com/feminish>The Feminish Collection</a>, dedicated to offering women of all sizes fun and fashionable clothing.</p><p class=dh>Tiffany revealed that she has had a passion <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/797566/the-untold-truth-of-michael-ohers-wife/>for fashion</a> since she was a young girl and that the Feminish Collection fulfills a dream. Feminish is sold through an online boutique dedicated to women of all cultures and sizes.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>How Long Have Tiffany Roy and Michael Oher Been Together?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Oher met his wife in college at the University of Mississippi seventeen years ago, and the two have been together ever since. In 2021, Oher finally popped the question, and the couple was married in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p class=dh>Tiffany was determined that everything about her long-awaited special day should be perfect, especially her dress. Tiffany wore a stunning lace dress with a cutaway back and criss-cross spaghetti straps that flowed into a train. Like a true queen, she wore a flower tiara on her wedding day.</p><p class=dh>The couple exchanged emotional vows, and Oher declared his enduring love for Tiffany in front of over 200 guests. The bride <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/sports/michael-oher-who-inspired-the-blind-side-is-married/>revealed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Michael has a glow in his eyes when he looks at me. He puts me first no matter what he has on his schedule for the day he makes sure his family is taken care of. I love his love for his family and our kids."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Does Michael Oher have kids with Tiffany Roy?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>What made the day more special for Tiffany and Oher was that the handsome young man walking the bride down the aisle was their son, Kobi. Kobi is the oldest of the couple's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Ckpk2OJOhgF/>four children</a> and has a brother, MJ, and two sisters: Kierstin and Naivi.</p><p class=dh>Oher beat the odds, overcame his past, and built a beautiful, loving family.
