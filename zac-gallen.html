He plays as a pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played college baseball for nearly three seasons for the North Carolina Tar Heels. Later, he was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2016 MLB draft in the third round.</span></p><p><span>After playing for one season for the St. Louis Cardinals, he was traded to the Miami Marlins in 2017. During the 2019 season, he was transferred to the Diamondbacks. In 2023, he was named the starting pitcher for the All-Star Games of the National League.</span></p><h2><b>Zac Gallen Bio, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Parents, Net Worth</b></h2><p><span>Gallen was born on 3rd August 1995 in Somerdale, New Jersey, to his loving and caring parents, Jim and Stacy Gallen. When he was five years old, he declined the decision to play in the tee-ball team with his peers. Instead, he demanded to play Little League Baseball with the Somerdale team.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, he was taken by his father’s team to the third round of the Little League draft. It was decided that he would now play with children between seven and nine years old. </span><span>After that, at 11, Gallen joined the Tri-state Arsenal Baseball Academy, where he started playing as a pitcher and second baseman.</span></p><p><span>Then, he joined Bishop Eustace Preparatory School in Pennsauken Township and the University of North Carolina. </span>At the University of North Carolina, he played baseball continuously for three years. During his junior year 2016, he made a 4-3 [win-loss] record with a 2.79 ERA [Earned Run Average].</p><h3><b>Career</b></h3><p><span>Initially, Zac Gallen was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the third round of the MLB Draft 2016. While being with the Cardinals, he was promoted to different teams. </span><span>He made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Cardinals, then started the 2017 season with the Palm Beach Cardinals and was later promoted to the Springfield Cardinals and Memphis Redbirds.</span></p><p><span>In December 2017, he was traded to the Miami Marlins as a non-roster invitee to 2018 spring training. For the first season, he spent his time and energy for New Orleans Baby Cakes, where he scored 8-9 with an ERA of 3.65 in 25 starts.</span></p><p><span>At the beginning of 2019, he returned to New Orleans, and then in June 2019, he was promoted to the major leagues by the Marlins. The same night, he had his debut against the Cardinals recorded six strikeouts, and gave up one earned run over five innings pitched.</span></p><p><span>On 31st July 2019, Zac Gallen was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks. For the initial period, he had eight starts for Arizona and had a record of 2 – 3 with an ERA of 2.89 in 43+2⁄3 innings, striking out 53. Then, in 2020, he recorded 82 strikeouts in 72 innings and finished the season with an ERA of 2.75 and a record of 3 – 2.</span></p><p><span>In January 2023, Zac Gallen made a contract for one year with the Diamondbacks while getting agreed on the contractual amount of $5.6 million for one year without any salary arbitration. He was named NL Player of the Week from 10 to 16th April.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>The MLB World Series 2023</b></h4><p><span>Game one was scheduled to take place between the Texas Rangers and the Arizona Diamondbacks. The World Series has just begun on Friday, 27th October 2023. On the first day of the game between the Texas Rangers and the Arizona Diamondbacks, there was a mixed working capacity of Zac Gallen.</span></p><p><span>Zac was under control during the first five innings and scored three runs. </span><span>After that, he ran into trouble during the early matchup and when Corey Seager from the Rangers team walked before him.</span></p><p><span>Corey gave up a pair of runs to Evan Carter and Adolis Garcia, who made the postseason RBI record in the first inning. </span><span>The next game between the Rangers and the Diamondbacks will happen on 29th October 2023.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Zac Gallen Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Zachary Peter Gallen</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>3 August 1995</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>28 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Somerdale, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 2” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>–188 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 85 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 189 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zac-Gallen-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Jim Gallen</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Stacey Gallen</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Jay Gallen</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Who is his girlfriend?</td><td>Elise Loughran</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Personal Life</b></h3><p><span>Zac is currently dating Elise Loughran, a scholar at the University of Arizona. Presently, she is working as an accounts executive. She seems to be there, cheerleading for Zac or when Zac is playing on the field. She has posted lots of pictures on Instagram @</span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>eliseloughran</span></a><span>, where she has 3,941 followers and 794 following members with only 50 posts.</span></p><h4><b>Social Media</b></h4><p><span>Zac is available on Instagram with a verified name – </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>zac_gallen</span></a><span>, and 37.4K followers. On </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>6th May 2023</span></a><span>, Zac Gallen wished Elise Loughran “Happy birthday” with a long message and a few adorable words, including “…I Love You mucho!…”&nbsp;</span><span>He has also posted </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>a picture</span></a><span> of two ladies sitting on a restaurant table. One of those ladies is tagged with the name – </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>alyssa_cunningham</span></a><span>. He gave the caption to that picture, “Family.”</span></p><h3><b>Zac Gallen Net Worth</b></h3><p>Zac signed a $5.6 million, one-year contract, that benefits the Diamondbacks by locking him in before he hits free agency. The team, with ample funds, sees this move as ideal. Arizona, a big media market, aims to secure Gallen’s services before he commands a massive pitcher’s contract.</p><p>His value will likely rise if he stays healthy, contributing to the team’s advantage. As he remains far from free agency, Gallen’s potential for growth is considerable. This move secures him before potentially demanding a top-tier pitcher’s salary.</p><h3><b>Trivia</b></h3><ul><li aria-level=1><span>Zac Gallen also won the NL Player of the Week award from 29th August to 4th September 2022.</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>The same year, he was honored with the NL Pitcher of the Month award for August.</span></li></ul><span class=simplesocialtxt>Facebook</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Twitter</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Reddit</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>WhatsApp</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Pinterest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYrKeyZpOkunDGwJxkoJmcobKvew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzac-gallen.html&text=Zac%20Gallen%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzac-gallen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzac-gallen.html&title=Zac%20Gallen%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzac-gallen.html&title=Zac%20Gallen%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzac-gallen.html&title=Zac%20Gallen%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzac-gallen.html&description=Zac%20Gallen%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-does-the-bachelorette-pick-in-2023-charity-goes-for-right-choice.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Who does The Bachelorette pick in 2023?
