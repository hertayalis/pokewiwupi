Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., even cited the billionaire in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2005 NBC News article</a> about the perils of genetic testing for autism—and the ASD diagnosis some refer to as Asperger’s in particular.</p><p>“Gates is widely reported to display many personality traits characteristic of a condition known as Asperger’s syndrome,” Caplan wrote. “While I certainly do not know if Gates has Asperger’s, his difficulties in social settings are nearly as legendary as his genius, so it’s possible.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Caplan, then the director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, asked readers what they would have done if they were Gates’ parents and knew that their baby would have Asperger’s.</p><p>“There is a good chance we will soon have a genetic test for detecting the risk of autism in an embryo or fetus. … The genes for autism and Asperger’s will soon be found,” he wrote. “When they are, my question—would you have stopped Bill Gates from existing?—will take on a very real meaning.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">If Gates does have an autism spectrum disorder, he joins other big names.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marketrealist.com/data:><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2019 MassLive article</a>, Lisa Natcharian commented on the speculation that the <a href=#>Microsoft</a> co-founder is living with Asperger’s, citing his habit of rocking back and forth and his “disdain” of others’ opinions. “While no doctor has ever given Mr. Gates an official diagnosis, he stands as a hero for many ‘Aspies’ who look to his success with hope,” Natcharian added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course, other celebrities have found success while living with autism spectrum disorders. <a href=#>Tesla</a> CEO <a href=#>Elon Musk</a> proclaimed himself as having Asperger’s earlier this year on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>, for instance. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aspergers Victoria</a> reports that comedian Dan Akroyd, director Tim Burton, scientist Temple Grandin, actress Daryl Hannah, Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri, and actor Anthony Hopkins all have confirmed autism diagnoses, too.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">A run-in with Gates helped Bill Gross realize that he has Asperger’s.</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2019 Bloomberg interview</a> about his own autism, fund manager and PIMCO co-founder Bill Gross mentioned Gates. Gross said that his ex-wife connected his own Asperger’s-related behaviors to Gates’ mannerisms.</p><p>Gross started thinking that he had the syndrome after reading about <a href=#>Michael Burry's</a> case of Asperger’s in the book The Big Short. “I took the book out to my ex-wife,” he recalled. “I said, ‘Read this.’ And she read it.

Your mannerisms were all the same.’”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Asperger syndrome is now part of autism spectrum disorder.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Autism Speaks</a>, Asperger syndrome—or Asperger’s—was a diagnosis on the autism spectrum until 2013, when it was folded into the umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.</p><p>The syndrome generally involves difficulty with social interactions, restricted interests, and a desire for sameness, according to the organization. Challenges for people with Asperger’s include hypersensitivity to sensory experiences, difficulty with conversation and nonverbal cues, clumsiness, anxiety, and depression. Strengths, meanwhile, include remarkable focus and persistence, aptitude for pattern recognition, and attention to detail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaJyfmsBursilo2afkamytHnHmq2eZZGqwaq%2FzGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html&text=Does%20Bill%20Gates%20Have%20Autism%3f%20Billionaire%20Speculated%20to%20Have%20Aspergers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html&title=Does%20Bill%20Gates%20Have%20Autism%3f%20Billionaire%20Speculated%20to%20Have%20Aspergers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html&title=Does%20Bill%20Gates%20Have%20Autism%3f%20Billionaire%20Speculated%20to%20Have%20Aspergers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html&title=Does%20Bill%20Gates%20Have%20Autism%3f%20Billionaire%20Speculated%20to%20Have%20Aspergers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-bill-gates-have-autism.html&description=Does%20Bill%20Gates%20Have%20Autism%3f%20Billionaire%20Speculated%20to%20Have%20Aspergers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-miola-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Miola Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./asus-eeepc-1215n-ng-ion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Conclusion: Decent but Atom Remains Slow">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
